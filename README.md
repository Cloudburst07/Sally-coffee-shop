# Sally-coffee-shop
A small webgame I made about working in a coffee shop.
This is a 2.0 version of a game I made when I just started coding. Instead of it simply being to guess a random number, I made a full simulation for making coffee with 4 different minigames, plenty of storylines, more image, more scenes, and more variety in general. 
## Enjoy!
